		<h2>Early Life</h2>
		<p>Kory Ripperda was born in 1986 in a small farming community in Illinois. Early in life, he moved to a bigger town where he lived a quiet suburban life. 
            His mother was a police officer while his father worked for a trucking company. He enjoyed riding his bike through the neighborhood and playing street hockey. He was always the one to go down into the sewer to get the hockey puck or ball.
            He began playing basketball at age 9 and has not stopped since, playing all through high school and continuing in mens leagues today.
            At around age 12, Kory and his family moved to a plot of land surrounded by farms which would become what he calls his hometown - St. Jacob, Illinois.
            Kory attended Triad High School in Troy, Illinois, playing basketball and football all four years. He was also involved in several clubs and organizations.</p>

         <h2>College</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>Kory initially attended Northern Illinois University with the intention of becoming a physical therapist. 
        While that plan did not work out, he transferred to Southern Illinois University Edwardsville <a href="siue.edu">(SIUE)</a> where he intended to become a police officer. Kory took several Criminal Justice classes and even tested for a local police department before being excluded as not old enough.
        This set back pushed Kory to consider business as a career. While working at a local grocery store, Kory became an assistant manager. He worked for that same store on and off for 7 years. 
        Kory participated in a study abroad opportunity in Germany which allowed their host students to return to SIUE the following year.
        <strong>While hosting the German students, Kory met who would be his future wife. They reconnected when she came out to his small town homecoming while he was tending the beer stand.</strong>
        Kory graduated from SIUE in 2010 with a dual major Bachelor of Science in International Business and Marketing with minors in German and Criminal Justice. </p>
